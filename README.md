# Project 1

Project 1 shows a data script with Databricks. In this project I build a new repo, scaffolding files, and connect it to github actions. I used the databricks in Azure, a new database was created. The database was initialized using the csv file I found in Kaggle. The table shows the salaries for data science student. Then I used Click to create a CLI program. It can be used to calculate the average salary for a specific year.
