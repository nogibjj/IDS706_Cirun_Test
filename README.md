Test the GitHub Codespace
# Project 1

Project 1 shows a data script with Databricks. In this project I build a new repo, scaffolding files, and connect it to github actions. I used the databricks in Azure, a new database was created. The database was initialized using the csv file I found in Kaggle. The table shows the salaries for data science student. Then I used Click to create a CLI program. It can be used to calculate the average salary for a specific year.

# Project 2

Project 2 aims to build a REST API and a command line tool. I created a python script `proj2.py`, it was used to parse the csv input file with numpy API, and send the file content to the API endpoint via HTTP Get. The REST API was build with AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway, it read the input numbers, sort them, and returns the sorted result.
